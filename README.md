--- Project Purpose ---
To create a daily planner to keep track of important events for a user

--- How it Works ---
GIVEN you are using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN you open the planner
THEN the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar
THEN you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN you click into a time block
THEN you can enter an event
WHEN you click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN you refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
